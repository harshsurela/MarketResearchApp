According to [5], over 92% of businesses are leveraging AI-driven personalization to drive customer engagement and improve overall customer experience. This trend is also evident in the ITAM industry, where AI is being used to automate and optimize various IT asset management processes.\n\nIn addition, the overall food price outlook for 2025 is expected to rise at a rate similar to that of 2024 and at a slower pace than the historical average rate of growth [1]. This stable food price outlook is expected to have a positive impact on the ITAM industry, as it will allow businesses to allocate more resources towards the adoption of AI technologies.\n\nHowever, the market for AI in ITAM is highly competitive, with a number of leading global technology market analyst firms, such as Canalys [2], providing channels and tech analysis for the industry. To succeed in this market, ITAM companies will need to differentiate themselves through innovative solutions and market-leading growth strategies.\n\n## Market Overview\n\nThe ITAM market is expected to grow in the coming years, driven by the increasing adoption of AI technologies and the need for efficient and cost-effective IT asset management. According to [3], the growth of the cloud services market and workstyle reforms in Japan are major factors driving the ITAM market in the country.\n\nIn addition, the retail industry is also expected to be a major driver of the AI in ITAM market. With the increasing adoption of AR technology in retail [8], there is a growing need for efficient IT asset management to support the deployment and maintenance of these AR systems.\n\nFurthermore, the automotive market is also expected to be a significant contributor to the AI in ITAM market. According to [9], the Frost & Sullivan Automotive practice provides global market intelligence and prescriptive research to execute market growth opportunities in the automotive industry. This includes the adoption of AI technologies for IT asset management.\n\n## Competitive Analysis\n\nThe market for AI in ITAM is highly competitive, with a number of leading global technology market analyst firms, such as Canalys [2], providing channels and tech analysis for the industry. These firms provide in-depth analysis of the market and offer insights and recommendations for companies looking to succeed in the AI in ITAM market.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of ITAM companies that are leveraging AI technologies to differentiate themselves in the market. For example, [6] highlights a retail summit that added a new photo featuring AI technology that allows users to snap a picture of their resale item and receive an estimated market value. This use of AI technology not only provides a better customer experience, but also helps the company to balance growth with brand authenticity.\n\nFurthermore, [10] highlights the trend of service providers leveraging AI to produce a better service. This is a key differentiator for ITAM companies, as it allows them to provide more efficient and cost-effective IT asset management solutions.\n\n## Actionable Insights and Recommendations\n\n* ITAM companies should consider leveraging AI technologies to differentiate themselves in the market and provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions.\n* Companies should focus on balancing growth with brand authenticity, as highlighted in [6].\n* ITAM companies should align their ad tactics and consumer preferences to protect brand perception, as highlighted in [7].\n* Companies should keep an eye on the retail and automotive markets, as these are expected to be major drivers of the AI in ITAM market.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe market for AI in ITAM is expected to grow in the coming years, driven by the increasing adoption of AI technologies and the need for efficient and cost-effective IT asset management. To succeed in this market, ITAM companies will need to differentiate themselves through innovative solutions and market-leading growth strategies. The retail and automotive markets are expected to be major drivers of the AI in ITAM market, and companies should focus on balancing growth with brand authenticity.\n\n## References\n\n1.
